========
Function
========
pract2.py is a program that will accept two SDF files of
a single molecule and a list of molecules as inputs.

1. The prorgam will give out the molecule name, max extent,
min extent, simple centre of gravity, weighted centre of
gravity, box size of each molecule. Also it will calculate
the box similarity between the reference molecule and each
molecule in the list.TWO similarities will be given.
The algorithm of the similarity calculation is shown in the result.

2. Futhermore, the program will also plot the distribution of
the similarity, and the 2d structure of each molecule.

======
Usage:
======
python pract2.py input1 input2

=====
Note:
=====
1. All the results are knitted into a html file. If you are
using mscoc3 to run the program, it will natively call the
inbuilt firefox to open the html file.

2. Since two similarities indicate different most similar
boxes, the program will point out which molecule has the
most similar box size in the title of the distribution plot.

3.data will be formatted in a dataframe. The first row
of the dataframe is the single molecule with the index name
"Single Mol". The rest of the molecules are molecules in the
list, the index indicates the corresponding sequence of the
molecules in the list, also it intuitively tells you how many
molecules are in the list.

===========
Limitation:
===========
The mscoc3 inbuilt firefox might possibly be to laggy to use.
You can right click the HTML file in the directory to open it
with your local broswer if you are using MobaXterm.
