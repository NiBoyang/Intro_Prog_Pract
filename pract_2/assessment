Practical Exercise 2 Worth 30 marks (reminder Your total marks from all three exercises are your course mark)

In this exercise I want you to read in a file that is formatted as an SD file. 
This is a very common format in drug discovery used as a standard format for storing small molecules.

I do not expect you to write code to read this format, we will read it with an external library. 
Part of the learning outcomes of this practical is to explore this external library and learn how to utilise the features of such a library. 
There are two ways to read from this format either a single molecule or a set of molecules from each file. 
I will give you a test file for both, the single molecule is called rfp.sdf and the multiple set is called lfp.sdf. 
For each molecule calculate and store somehow its centre of gravity, the extent of the molecule (ie the minimum and maximum x,y,z of each molecule. 
Them compare the molecules in lfp to the single molecule in rfp.sdf and report the molecule in lfp where the box size is most similar. 
You could enhance the program by analysing the distribution of differences in some way. 
As previously a pass mark would (15) would be awarded for a basic functioning program. 
This can be enhanced by appropriate and correct comments, a useful readme file, and enhancements to the code to improve its functionality
